        <li>Prepare the dough: Mix flour, water, and a pinch of salt to create a smooth dough. Let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the filling: Combine ground meat (beef, pork, or a mix), finely chopped onions, garlic, salt, pepper, and fresh cilantro. Add a little water to make the filling juicy.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough: Divide the dough into small portions and roll them into thin circles about 3-4 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Add the filling: Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each dough circle.</li>
        <li>Shape the khinkali: Pinch the edges of the dough together to create pleats, forming a pouch-like shape. Twist the top to seal it tightly.</li>
        <li>Boil the khinkali: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the khinkali and cook for 7-10 minutes, stirring gently to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Serve: Carefully remove the khinkali with a slotted spoon and serve hot with freshly ground black pepper.</li>
